# Virtual-Hackathon
This is a project to analyse the analyse and predict COVID cases in the world. It has been done using Python.

  The packages involves:<br>
* Sci-kit : Scikit-learn is a free software machine learning library for the Python programming language. It features various classification, regression and clustering algorithms including support vector machines<br>
* pandas : Its key data structure is called the DataFrame. DataFrames allow you to store and manipulate tabular data in rows of observations and columns of variables.<br>
* numpy : NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.<br>
* plotly : Plotly Python library is an interactive, open-source plotting library that supports over 40 unique chart types covering a wide range of statistical, financial, geographic, scientific, and 3-dimensional use-cases.<br>
